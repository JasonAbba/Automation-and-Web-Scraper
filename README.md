# Automation-and-Web-Scraper
Interacts with my college student portal to retrieve my attendance and other details.

## Introduction

The idea of a web scraper with auto login functionality came to me when I had to constantly go through the login validation and verification process of my college student portal (because it had no remember me option :/). It was boring and I had to click a bunch of buttons and select a couple of parameters to view my attendance. There you have it, I wrote a python script that would automate the process for me and save me some good time.

## Technologies

The libraries used in the project are
* Selenium
* time
* requests
* tabulate

## Setup

* Download and Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* `pip install` the libraries
* To run the script `python scrapAttendance.py`
